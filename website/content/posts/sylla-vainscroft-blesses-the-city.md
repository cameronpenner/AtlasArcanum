_Sylla Vainscroft performed in the Crystalpol Vocalarium her penultimate show of her Light and Shadow tour across the continent of Toth. _

As if a piece of the heavens’ light descended upon the streets of Dualport, so too did the heavenly song of Sylla Vainscroft brighten the streets of the city this past weekend.

Travelling the length and breadth of the continent showcasing her newest work, “The Tale of Light and Shadow”, of which Vainscroft performed her penultimate show of her Tour last night in the Crystapol Vocalarium. People from near and far travelled to witness the musical spectacle and nobles and lay folk alike were transported away on a mystical journey of sound, light and magic, as the famed singer and wizard performed a show of a lifetime.

Composed of three movements, Vainscroft first stunned audiences with a melancholy ensemble of vocal artistry recollecting the wonders of Tao. The haunting melodies paired with the awe inspiring arcane conjurations of auras and energies told the tale of the founding of the great city of old and enchanted the audience into a receptive and reflexive outlook for the second movement.

Beginning with a bang of literal and figurative proportions, Vainscroft‘s second movement painted the dramatic and tragic tale of The Fall of Tao. The exquisite dance of arcane energy, electrified the atmosphere and the angelic voice of Sylla painted the Vocalarium with vivid shades of triumph, defeat, war and peace and moving into the third movement, nary a dry eye was left in the hall.

Finally ending the night, Vainscroft’s third movement, Titled “the Reckoning of the Shadow”, brought the show to a climactic conclusion in a finale that seemed to rock the foundations of the city itself. The use of arcane fire and light, thaumaturgic vocal alterations and Vainscroft’s sheer musical power created such a spectacle that when it was all over, the hall was left in speechless silence for almost a minute before thunderous applause erupted.

A performance of this magnitude will truly be remembered in the hearts and minds of the people of our city for years to come. Sylla Vainscroft is among the great bards of our time and her performance this week earned her a rune carved in the Hall of Wonder, which will be opened to the public later this month.

The rune will project a brief moment of the third movement depicting the climactic victory over Arcblight.

If Music is a deep magic, Sylla enchanted the Dualport with a beautiful spell which will resonate for years to come.
