Welcome to The Oracle, a place where stories are shared and Dualport’s first news-scroll. The Oracle is a part of the larger Atlas Arcanum Corporation and represents a common ground for the citizens of this great city to learn about the stories from within our borders, and from far away lands around the entire Atlas.

With war, isolation and hostility still fresh in our history, the importance of stories that can bring us together, unify and connect us to the broader Atlas, has become all the more great. So what can you expect from this new chapter in our city’s story?

The Oracle’s commitment is to serve the City of Dualport’s citizens with relevant news. The stories we will cover will range from the happenings within the city that are noteworthy, such as events, politics or crime, to tales of travel and adventure from the far reaches of the Atlas. You might also find articles about new discoveries in arcane knowledge or the history of our city. You might also be interested in following the latest scores of Siegeball games at the Stadium Arantis or learn about the weather patterns that affect us daily. No matter why you come, there is a reason for you to stay.

Stories are what connect communities. So join us as we tell the stories about Dualport and the Atlas beyond.
