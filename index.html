                    > “Stories are the lifeblood of community. They connect us together as they teach us of joy, sorrow
                    and the world around us. Without stories, the world would be a colder place.”

                    Welcome to The Oracle, a place where stories are shared and Dualport’s first news-scroll. The Oracle
                    is a part of the larger Atlas Arcanum Corporation and represents a common ground for the citizens of
                    this great city to learn about the stories from within our borders, and from far away lands around
                    the entire Atlas.
</p>
<p>
                    With war, isolation and hostility still fresh in our history, the importance of stories that can
                    bring us together, unify and connect us to the broader Atlas, has become all the more great. So what
                    can you expect from this new chapter in our city’s story?
</p>
<p>
                    The Oracle’s commitment is to serve the City of Dualport’s citizens with relevant news. The stories
                    we will cover will range from the happenings within the city that are noteworthy, such as events,
                    politics or crime, to tales of travel and adventure from the far reaches of the Atlas. You might
                    also find articles about new discoveries in arcane knowledge or the history of our city. You might
                    also be interested in following the latest scores of Siegeball games at the Stadium Arantis or learn

                <h3>Mysterious Crime Leaves Authorities Baffled</h3>
                <img src="article2-image.jpg" alt="Article 2 Image">
                <p>_A strange Break and Enter involving prototype weapons and archanical components found at the scene
                    of the crime leaves residents and authorities confused._
</p>
<p>
                    Last night, residents of Clear Street were awoken to a strange sound that pulsed through the
                    neighbourhood in the early hours of the morning. While some took no notice, a handful of vigilant
                    individuals notified the authorities to the noise saying it sounded like a low and deep thrumming.
</p>
<p>
                    Thinking they were being called to a regular sound complaint, the authorities arrived at the house
                    that seemed to be the epicentre of the sound only to find a baffling scene before them.
</p>
<p>
                    The house, belonging to a young couple who was away for the week visiting family in Granger, was
                    found empty, with a strong scent of pine and sulphur, and in the basement a cluttered mess of
                    machine parts, archanical mechanisms, fuel sources and a host of strange looking weapon prototypes.
</p>
<p>
                    The authorities have since inspected the scene and confiscated the evidence, but all traces of who
                    was behind the weapons and the strange noise in the night have vanished.
</p>
<p>
                    > “It's deeply unsettling, knowing someone was in your house and plotting for something. We will be
                    sleeping one eye open for the next little bit.” - _Flinn Celder, owner of the house._
</p>
<p>
                    A unit of guards have been posted in the area to patrol and look for any signs of suspicious
                    activity.
</p>
<p>
                    If you know anything more about this story, authorities are urging everyone with information to come
                    forward, so that the criminal behind this strange crime can be brought to justice and so the good
                    people of DualPort may once again rest easy.
