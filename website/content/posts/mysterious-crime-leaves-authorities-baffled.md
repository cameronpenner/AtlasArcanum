_A strange Break and Enter involving prototype weapons and archanical components found at the scene of the crime leaves residents and authorities confused._

Last night, residents of Clear Street were awoken to a strange sound that pulsed through the neighbourhood in the early hours of the morning. While some took no notice, a handful of vigilant individuals notified the authorities to the noise saying it sounded like a low and deep thrumming.

Thinking they were being called to a regular sound complaint, the authorities arrived at the house that seemed to be the epicentre of the sound only to find a baffling scene before them.

The house, belonging to a young couple who was away for the week visiting family in Granger, was found empty, with a strong scent of pine and sulphur, and in the basement a cluttered mess of machine parts, archanical mechanisms, fuel sources and a host of strange looking weapon prototypes.

The authorities have since inspected the scene and confiscated the evidence, but all traces of who was behind the weapons and the strange noise in the night have vanished.

> “It's deeply unsettling, knowing someone was in your house and plotting for something. We will be sleeping one eye open for the next little bit.” - _Flinn Celder, owner of the house._

A unit of guards have been posted in the area to patrol and look for any signs of suspicious activity.

If you know anything more about this story, authorities are urging everyone with information to come forward, so that the criminal behind this strange crime can be brought to justice and so the good people of DualPort may once again rest easy.
