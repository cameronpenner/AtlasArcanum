                “Stories are the lifeblood of community. They connect us together as they teach us of joy, sorrow
                and the world around us. Without stories, the world would be a colder place.”

                Welcome to The Oracle, a place where stories are shared and Dualport’s first news-scroll. The Oracle
                is a part of the larger Atlas Arcanum Corporation and represents a common ground for the citizens of
                this great city to learn about the stories from within our borders, and from far away lands around
                the entire Atlas.
                </p>
                <p>
                With war, isolation and hostility still fresh in our history, the importance of stories that can
                bring us together, unify and connect us to the broader Atlas, has become all the more great. So what
                can you expect from this new chapter in our city’s story?
                </p>
                <p>
                The Oracle’s commitment is to serve the City of Dualport’s citizens with relevant news. The stories
                we will cover will range from the happenings within the city that are noteworthy, such as events,
                politics or crime, to tales of travel and adventure from the far reaches of the Atlas. You might
                also find articles about new discoveries in arcane knowledge or the history of our city. You might
                also be interested in following the latest scores of Siegeball games at the Stadium Arantis or learn
                about the weather patterns that affect us daily. No matter why you come, there is a reason for you
                to stay.
                </p>

                    <p>_A strange Break and Enter involving prototype weapons and archanical components found at the
                        scene
                        of the crime leaves residents and authorities confused._
                    </p>
                </small-article-head>
                <p>
                    Last night, residents of Clear Street were awoken to a strange sound that pulsed through the
                    neighbourhood in the early hours of the morning. While some took no notice, a handful of vigilant
                    individuals notified the authorities to the noise saying it sounded like a low and deep thrumming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thinking they were being called to a regular sound complaint, the authorities arrived at the house
                    that seemed to be the epicentre of the sound only to find a baffling scene before them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The house, belonging to a young couple who was away for the week visiting family in Granger, was
                    found empty, with a strong scent of pine and sulphur, and in the basement a cluttered mess of
                    machine parts, archanical mechanisms, fuel sources and a host of strange looking weapon prototypes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The authorities have since inspected the scene and confiscated the evidence, but all traces of who
                    was behind the weapons and the strange noise in the night have vanished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    > “It's deeply unsettling, knowing someone was in your house and plotting for something. We will be
                    sleeping one eye open for the next little bit.” - _Flinn Celder, owner of the house._
                </p>
                <p>
                    A unit of guards have been posted in the area to patrol and look for any signs of suspicious
                    activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you know anything more about this story, authorities are urging everyone with information to come
                    forward, so that the criminal behind this strange crime can be brought to justice and so the good
                    people of DualPort may once again rest easy.

                    <!-- <img src="content/opera.jpg" alt="Article 3 Image"> -->
                    <p>_Sylla Vainscroft performed in the Crystalpol Vocalarium her penultimate show of her Light and Shadow
                        tour across the continent of Toth. _
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As if a piece of the heavens’ light descended upon the streets of Dualport, so too did the heavenly
                        song of Sylla Vainscroft brighten the streets of the city this past weekend.
                    </p>
                </small-article-head>
                <p>
                    Travelling the length and breadth of the continent showcasing her newest work, “The Tale of Light
                    and Shadow”, of which Vainscroft performed her penultimate show of her Tour last night in the
                    Crystapol Vocalarium. People from near and far travelled to witness the musical spectacle and nobles
                    and lay folk alike were transported away on a mystical journey of sound, light and magic, as the
                    famed singer and wizard performed a show of a lifetime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Composed of three movements, Vainscroft first stunned audiences with a melancholy ensemble of vocal
                    artistry recollecting the wonders of Tao. The haunting melodies paired with the awe inspiring arcane
                    conjurations of auras and energies told the tale of the founding of the great city of old and
                    enchanted the audience into a receptive and reflexive outlook for the second movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beginning with a bang of literal and figurative proportions, Vainscroft‘s second movement painted
                    the dramatic and tragic tale of The Fall of Tao. The exquisite dance of arcane energy, electrified
                    the atmosphere and the angelic voice of Sylla painted the Vocalarium with vivid shades of triumph,
                    defeat, war and peace and moving into the third movement, nary a dry eye was left in the hall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally ending the night, Vainscroft’s third movement, Titled “the Reckoning of the Shadow”, brought
                    the show to a climactic conclusion in a finale that seemed to rock the foundations of the city
                    itself. The use of arcane fire and light, thaumaturgic vocal alterations and Vainscroft’s sheer
                    musical power created such a spectacle that when it was all over, the hall was left in speechless
                    silence for almost a minute before thunderous applause erupted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A performance of this magnitude will truly be remembered in the hearts and minds of the people of
                    our city for years to come. Sylla Vainscroft is among the great bards of our time and her
                    performance this week earned her a rune carved in the Hall of Wonder, which will be opened to the
                    public later this month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rune will project a brief moment of the third movement depicting the climactic victory over
                    Arcblight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Music is a deep magic, Sylla enchanted the Dualport with a beautiful spell which will resonate
                    for years to come.

                    A performance of this magnitude will truly be remembered in the hearts and minds of the people of
                    our city for years to come. Sylla Vainscroft is among the great bards of our time and her
                    performance this week earned her a rune carved in the Hall of Wonder, which will be opened to the
                    public later this month.

                    The rune will project a brief moment of the third movement depicting the climactic victory over
                    Arcblight.

                    If Music is a deep magic, Sylla enchanted the Dualport with a beautiful spell which will resonate
                    for years to come.
